Question 1:
Why is a Version Control System useful when developing software both as an individual developer and as part of a development team?

Version control are systems that allows a single developer or a team of developers to track, manage and change their software code. Version control has been around for many years having been created in the early 1970s. Since then version control has profoundly improved with the help of technology advancements. 

Version control enables teams to work harder and smarter because different departments/employees can work on the code at the same time. GitHub is a well established version control system and allows teams to programm their code effectively. With the use of a tool called branches the tea are able to make a copy of the existing code to allow multiple people to work on the code at the same time. Different versions are made and can be combined at a later point. Another positive about version control is the software keeps track of every modification, therefore if any mistakes are made the user can revert back to a previous version of the document. 

Each programmer in the team can have their own version of the program by creating a branch.
